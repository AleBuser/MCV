# **Book of Rituals**

## I. Membership Criteria

### A. All Members

* must pass MCV's background checks performed through CoinList;
* must not be "bad actors" under Regulation D or belong to any other category that would make the MCV ineligible to invest in private placements of securities by other projects/DAOs/companies.
* must be of the legal age of maturity in all relevant jurisdictions, of sound mind, and capable of entering into binding and enforceable legal agreements,  have sole title to all property they contribute to MCV, free of all liens and encumbrances, and otherwise able to honestly make the representations of Members set forth in the Grimoire
* if they are not "accredited investors," must be seeking admission as Mages and meet the criteria of Mages
* must not be discriminated against based on any legally protected category such as age, race, national origin or gender
* must have received the Grimoire and all Exhibits and have signed a copy of the Joinder Agreement to agree to their terms

### B. Mages

Mages must be evaluated for membership eligibility based on their demonstrated ability and willingness to assist in actively managing and monitoring MCV, and not merely based on their willingness to contribute capital to MCV. While members may in their sole and absolute discretion take into account additional factors in voting whether to admit a new Mage, members must reasonably and in good faith determine that the potential Mage has the relevant ability and willingness to serve as active MCV managers.

Without limiting the foregoing, a Member should not be admitted as a Mage if:
* such Member would have so little power or influence as a Mage that such Member would not be able to effectively exercise managerial responsibilities with the other Mages;
* such Member is so inexperienced and unknowledgeable in business affairs that such Member is incapable of intelligently exercising such Member's Mage powers; 
* such Member is so dependent on some unique entrepreneurial or managerial ability of one or more other Mage(s) that such Member could not act as a Mage without the assistance of such other Mage(s); or
* such Member does not plan to devote at least 3 hours a week to managing to MCV

### C. Goblins

All Goblins should be "accredited investors" under the U.S. federal securities laws (as confirmed through Coinlist accreditation check and back-up check by the Legal Mage) and the securities laws of the Goblin's particular jurisdiction. 

Goblins acquiring Shares should generally be evaluated based on the same criteria as Mages, except that, because they are "accredited investors," they are not required to participate as strictly, though still have all the powers and rights of managers. 

Goblins acquiring Loot, if any, should be evaluated especially strictly in determining their accreditation requirements. In general, it is understood that Goblins holding Loot are not a highly sought-after category of membership in MCV, as MCV may only have a limited number of Members and their active contributions are important. 


## II. MageLore

### Roles of Mages

* tracking contributions within MCV
* kicking or demoting non-active Mages
* doing operations work
* preparing meeting agendas
* writing notes for meetings
* preparing investment memos
* conducting investment due diligence
* collecting feedback and insights from various MCV members


### Participation Standards for Mages

* Minimum Participation Standards
    * Must regularly participate in the DAO's telegram group chat with relevant, substantive communications
    * Must appear (in person or electronically) somewhere once a year with all other Mages
    * Must carefully evaluate, discuss and vote on substantially all material Proposals. 
    * Must, alone or jointly with other Magesm be working to lead/champion a significant MCV initiative, which should lead to a Proposal at least once a year. A significant Proposal might be a promising opportunity for MCV to invest in another project, a worthwhile event or other valuable good or service sponsored by MCV, recruiting a valuable new Member or other material initiative benefiting the DAO and its members. The Proposal need not be approved for this requirement to be satisfied, provided that the proposal nevertheless represents substantial, good faith entrepreneurial efforts by the champion.
    * Mages who will not be active for a limited period of time for good reason due to life circumstances may arrange to have the absence approved in advance, in which case inactivity during the absence will not be penalized.

The Mages will actively monitor each other's participation and will issue warnings to one another for failure to meet the minimum participation rules. 

* Quarterly Performance Measurement

The Mages operate in accordance with the Earth’s seasons. At every turn of the season, the Mages will congregate together for the Cauldron Horizon where they will undergo a ceremony of awards and disciplinary punishments.

For an unaccredited Mage to be accepted into the DAO, they must earn their membership by pledging a meaningful contribution that is considered a management task/activity. This is when their watch will begin.

When someone does something fairly meaningful, it is recorded in the Magician’s blockchain aka, DAO members excel sheet tracking contributions

At the end of 3 months, there is be a tallying ceremony called the 'cauldron horizon' where the Mages' contributions are reviewd. Mages who have made strong contributions may be proposed to receive rewards via a Proposal to the Members. Mages who have materially failed to meet the minimum participation requirements will be either demoted (if they are eligible to become Goblins) or become the subject of a GuidKick Proposal which all Members will be strongly encouraged by the Mages to approve. 

 MetaCartel is working on the Pepper4D which may automate, enhance and formalize aspects of these performance standards:
